# FizzBuzz-Java

I installed Java Developer Kit onto my Mac

I write 'Hello World' in java
I got it to compile and run

I then commented it out and wrote FizzBuzz
I got that to compile and run

The things I learnt
- Every line of code must be inside a class
- Class names start with capital letters
- There has to be a main function
- The file name has to be the same as the class function
- I had to compile it first
- You have to declare what it returns
- You have to declare what datatypes the arguments are
- It has to start with main (String[] args)
